After an idea from the passing signal group.

Siteswaps can be created by concatenating puzzle-pieces. This is some code to create such pieces as SVG. 
Puzzle pieces have the property, that they  encode incoming and outgoing throws as puzzle holes and puzzle noses. Which means throws that have to come in on one of the sites inside the puzzle piece and how far outgoing throws go.

The siteswaps are seen in their causal representation to shorten the throws so that more dependencies are fulfilled from within the puzzle piece. 

For now, this focuses on puzzle pieces that have 4 siteswap numbers on them. Of those.

Because the number of incoming/outgoing connections always has to be the same, translation between puzzle pieces with a different number of holes/noses is not possible.

Most pieces had two incoming/outgoing throws, so we further focus on those.
